what happens when client cant get 2*f' + 1 proofs?

users have no encryption, shoud the requester just put the id alongside the proof in report or does it need to be the proofer sending its id so the requester knows it

Proof as location of proffer?? loc_ass

TODO:
 - Cryptography

 - server needs to store the state -> 2 Files

 - do error response need to be encrypted

 - Can f_line just be a random number | Calculate this property

 - client comunitcation need integrity | not sure yet

 - What should a byzantine user try?

 - Nonces added before confirming that idx did infact send that msg
