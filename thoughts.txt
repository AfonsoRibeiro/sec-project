what happens when client cant get 2*f' + 1 proofs?

users have no encryption, shoud the requester just put the id alongside the proof in report or does it need to be the proofer sending its id so the requester knows it

Proof as location of proffer??

TODO:
 - Cryptography

 - (K_ser K_req K_ass) Proof = {id_ass + {id_req + epoch, KPriv_ass}, KPub_ser}

 - Fix interval_at, starting all from same time //aprox should be enough

 - server needs to store the state, is a single file enough?

 - do error response need to be encrypted?

 - Save nonces and reports

 - Can f_line just be a random number?
