what happens when client cant get 2*f' + 1 proofs?

users have no encryption, shoud the requester just put the id alongside the proof in report or does it need to be the proofer sending its id so the requester knows it

Proof as location of proffer??

TODO:
 - (Maybe) HA_client also as access to grid, and compares server responses to expected (useful for testing)

 - Cryptography

 - (K_ser K_req K_ass) Proof = {id_ass + {id_req + epoch, KPriv_ass}, KPub_ser}

 - Fix interval_at, starting all from same time

 - server needs to store the state

 - do error response need to be encrypted?
