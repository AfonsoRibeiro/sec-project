Comunication between clients is not confidential. But should the proofs sent be encrypted?
How can the communication between clients be not encrypted if a proof must be given?

Does the server need to store the state?

what happens when client cant get 2*f' + 1 proofs?




TODO:
 - (Maybe) HA_client also as access to grid, and compares server responses to expected (useful for testing)

 - Cryptography

 - (K_ser K_req K_ass) Proof = {id_ass + {id_req + epoch, KPriv_ass}, KPub_ser}
